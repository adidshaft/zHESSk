# Zhessk - ZK Chess with Proof Verification

A chess game built with ZiskVM zero-knowledge proof generation, where every move is cryptographically verified and stored as a ZK proof.

## Features

- **Real-time Chess**: Play chess with full rule validation
- **ZK Proof Generation**: Each move generates a zero-knowledge proof
- **Proof Visualization**: See all game proofs in the left panel
- **Live Notifications**: Get notified when new proofs are generated
- **Move History**: Track all moves with cryptographic verification

## Getting Started

- npm or yarn
- Rust (for future ZisK integration)

### Installation
